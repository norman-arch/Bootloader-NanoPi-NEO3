# NanoPi NEO3

A tiny but power enough Rockchip RK3328 Soc, also less power consumption.
Works perfectly in my music system as a network audio interface (HQPlayer NAA and ROON Bridge).

I compiled NanoPi NEO3 bootloader images (official u-boot v2020.07 release), therefore easily get ArchLinux with customized realtime kernel installed on this board.
